title: 'Post 1 Title- A VISIT FROM THE GOON SQUAD',
content:"It is easier to conjure the intellectual-literary atmosphere of
an era when it is 30 years’ past than when it is a mere decade ago. It is hard
to see 2010 right now, as we wait for time and the canon to true the lens, but
I have a very clear sense-memory of revelation and exhilaration as I sped
through David Mitchell’s epic-historical ghost story, The Thousand Autumns of
Jacob de Zoet, wondering if the spirit of Robert Louis Stevenson had
momentarily taken possession of Haruki Murakami. Here was a reminder that the
world of a novel—in this case, a very detailed rendering of an 18th-century
Dutch trading post in the port of Nagasaki—can be fuller, more vivid, than our
own, that it can exist as a hothouse for the reader’s moral imagination.It is
difficult to say what another 25 years will make of The Thousand Autumns of
Jacob de Zoet. In the context of Mitchell’s more recent novels, and their
space-operatic excesses, the plot of De Zoet seems worryingly baroque,
show-offy, even. But it is clearly the work of the same writer who gave us the
near-perfect coming-of-age novel, Black Swan Green, its language similarly
precise and unexpected, all in aid of a story that seems somehow to tell
itself, a true history that never quite happened.",

title: 'Post 2Title- TRAIN DREAMS',
content:" If I was tasked with proving that literary awards are a cruel
joke and that life is nothing but a bleak and meaningless trudge toward the
grave, Exhibit A would be what I have dubbed The Great Pulitzer Prize for
Fiction Travesty of 2012. 2012 was, of course, the year the Pulitzer board
(not the jury) decided that no book published in the previous twelve months
merited the most prestigious honor in American letters, despite the fact that
the trinity of finalists included Denis Johnson’s hallucinatory masterwork
Train Dreams, as well as Karen Russell’s lushly brilliant debut novel
Swamplandia! and David Foster Wallace’s unfinished opus The Pale King.Michael
Cunningham in a rather wonderful letter to the New Yorker in the wake of the
non-decision). Train Dreams may well be the 21st century’s most perfect
novella (he said, having of course read them all…). It’s the incantatory
story of a turn-of-the-century logger and railroad laborer, Robert Grainier,
who loses his family to a wildfire and retreats deep into the woods of the
Idaho panhandle as the country modernizes around him. Johnson’s spare,
strange, elegiac prose conjures a world that feels both ancient and ephemeral,
full of beauty and menace and deep sorrow. As Anthony Doerr wrote in his New
York Times review: “His prose tiptoes a tightrope between peace and calamity,
and beneath all of the novella’s best moments, Johnson runs twin strains of
tenderness and the threat of violence.” An American epic in miniature, Train
Dreams is a visionary portrait of soul untethered from civilization, a man
stoically persevering on his own hermetic terms in the face of unimaginable
tragedy. A haunted and haunting reverie.",
